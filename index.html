<h2>Your game title</h2>
""Amidais: Where did I begin""
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Escape the dog pit you were placed in by wall jumping
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want to provide players with decent wall jumping mechanics.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Player can wall jump by pressing up and towards the wall. Players must switch between walls to get to chain wall jumps. I plan to use these mechanics to have a larger level with obstacles. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Wall jumping!
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
You can jump off walls.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are Amidais, a dog poorly designed by someone who thought non transparent sprite sheets were funny.  You must escape and ask your creator... why did you make me so??
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Left right left right left ri- oh you fell out of the level.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Dogs.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
30 seconds
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Alternating walls between jumps.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I borrowed the terrible dog from http://www.dickbaldwin.com/XNA/XNA0122/XNA0122.htm whom has no idea who made the sprites.  "I have a sneaking suspicion it is from harvest moon"
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I can think of no other games at 5:31 AM that resemble my game.  Good night.
